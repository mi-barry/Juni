# Fard
Fard is a long term calorie tracking app for iOS. Fard calculates a users total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), it then calculates that users total caloric burn and weight lost over a period of time allowing the user to monitor their progress and stay on track with their health and fitness goals.

## Coming in future versions
- Restructure and clean code
- Calculate "Adjusted TDEE"
	- Adjusted TDEE is determined by comparing daily caloric intake/burn and weight change over time
- Optimize user interface for smaller devices
